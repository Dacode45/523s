This package contains three binary programs: p1, p2, and p3.
These are 32-bit binaries, which is what we focused on in class.

You can invoke them with a command like the following.

  ./p1

Each will explain its usage if no command line arguments are
given. If, after download, they do not have execution privileges set,
you can do so as follows.

  chmod +x p1

Enjoy!
